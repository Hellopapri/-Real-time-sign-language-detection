#Real-time Sign Language Detection

This project is a real-time Sign Language Detection system that uses AI and computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures and translate them into readable text or spoken words. The system aims to bridge the communication gap for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.

##Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition
- Translation of gestures into text
- Optional speech output
- Works with common sign languages

##Installation
1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Real-time-Sign-Language-Detection.git

2. Install dependencies (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, etc.)
3. Run the main script to start detecting gestures in real-time

## Usage
- Use a webcam to capture hand gestures
- The system will display recognized gestures as text on the screen
- Optionally, it can convert recognized gestures to speech
